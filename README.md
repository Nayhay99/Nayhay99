### Hello. Namaste 🙏🏻
- I am Nayonika from Odisha, India.
- I am a BTech CSE grad student from IIIT Bhubaneswar, batch 2017-2021
- I have previously worked as SDE1 at Dell Technologies, Bengaluru - in the platform team of Dell Order Management Dept.
- Professionally I have worked in developing and maintaining robust & scalable applications in **Golang**, **Typescript** and **ReactJS**.
- I was in a study break of 6 months(Nov'22-May'22) to try out an alternative career in Diplomacy and Foreign Relations, but having failed to clear the exam, I am now focused to enhance my skills and crack a promising software developement role.
- While I understand job searching and interviewing can take its own sweet time, I, patiently, am using this time to brush up my concepts in Data Structures and algorithms, design patterns, fundamentals, database, operating system (plus regularly working out!)
- If you visited my profile and have any leads, kindly consider sharing it on nayonika99@outlook.com.
